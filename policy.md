# The Club Policy Guide
The club is party centered around performing sexual acts with members designated as the whores of the night. While club parties can be hosted by any group under any sexual orentation, this document assumes all participance are bisexual   

## Whores of the night
Members with the designation of "Whores of the night" (WotN) will service all other members. They are the center of the party and members would be encourged to use them as they want. A WotN will serve all comers regardless of their genital configuration. 

### Menu of Services

Prior to the WotN's shift they will be asked to create a menu of services they are willing to perform as well as those they are not. For example: A whore may be willing to preform oral sex and vaginal pentration sex but will not preform anal penitrative sex. For all intensive purposes this menu is a list of things the whore consents to preform and can be changed at anytime, even during the party. While body autonomy is parimount, all members are encourged to embrace trying new acts while serving as WotN.

### Happy Hour

At some spcified time during the night there will be an event called the happy hour. The happy hour goal is to have as many members orgasuming on the WotN as possible covering them with bodily fluids. 

## Members

Members are all the people that agree to participate in this communal sexual experince. Each member agrees to a behaviour code of conduct, privacy policy, health care checkup and testing regiment. All members must also commit to serving as Whore of the night at least 8 times over the course of the year. New members attending their first event must be WotN for that evening. This is to help encourage new members to get comfortable with all the rules as well as practicing consent for their wills and wonts. 

The club encourages members to put in everything you expect to get out, not just sexually but logisticly as well. Pitching in for setup, food services and especially for clean up. 

## The Party

Hosting members should see to ensuring a safe comfortable space is made avaiable for all members. The schedual should see that a number of WotN are avaiable and have RSVP'ed. The Whores menu of services should be posted and acknowledged by all members pior to entry to the party. Hosting members are responcible for supplying lube, condoms, food and basic drink for all members, a fee can be collected for this purpose.
